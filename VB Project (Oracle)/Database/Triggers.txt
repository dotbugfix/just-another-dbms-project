Triggers cannot be exported from the Oracle database and have to be created manually. Use the following syntax to create triggers:

*** Trigger remove_rides
SQL> create trigger remove_rides
  2  before delete on rides
  3  referencing old as oldrow
  4  for each row
  5  begin
  6  delete (select * from log_visitor where action_name=:oldrow.name);
  7  delete (select * from log_staff_mechanic where ride_name=:oldrow.name);
  8  end remove_rides;
  9  .
SQL> run
  
Trigger created.

*** Trigger Fire_Staff
SQL> create trigger fire_staff
  2  before delete on staff
  3  referencing old as oldrow
  4  for each row
  5  begin
  6  delete (select * from log_staff_assistant where staff_login=:oldrow.username);
  7  delete (select * from log_staff_mechanic where staff_login=:oldrow.username);
  8  end fire_staff;
  9  .
SQL> run
 
Trigger created.
